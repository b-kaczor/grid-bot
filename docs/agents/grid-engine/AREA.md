# Grid Engine Area

## Overview

The grid engine is the core trading system of Volatility Harvester. It manages the lifecycle of grid trading bots: calculating price levels, placing/cancelling orders on exchanges, processing fills, and tracking profit.

## Boundaries

- **Exchange communication**: All exchange interaction goes through the `Exchange::Adapter` interface. Bybit is the first (and currently only) implementation.
- **Bot lifecycle**: `pending -> initializing -> running -> paused -> stopped`. Transitions are driven by user actions, exchange events, and risk management triggers.
- **Data flow**: Exchange WebSocket -> Redis stream -> Sidekiq worker -> PostgreSQL. Redis holds hot state for fast reads; PostgreSQL is the source of truth.

## Key Patterns

- **Service objects** in `app/services/` for all business logic. Controllers are thin.
- **Exchange::Adapter** abstract interface — all exchange clients implement it so grid logic is exchange-agnostic.
- **Optimistic locking** on `grid_levels` to prevent duplicate counter-orders from concurrent fill processing.
- **Order link ID** format `g{bot_id}L{level_index}{B|S}{cycle_count}` for idempotency and reconciliation.
- **Fee-adjusted quantities**: `net_quantity` tracks actual received amount after exchange fees. Sell orders use `net_quantity` from the preceding buy to prevent base asset leakage.

## Constraints

- Bybit rate limits: 20 req/s order create/cancel, 10 req/s batch/query, 600 req per 5s IP limit.
- Bybit account limit: 500 open orders total.
- All decimal math uses `BigDecimal` — never floats for financial calculations.
- Prices rounded to `tick_size`, quantities to `base_precision`.
